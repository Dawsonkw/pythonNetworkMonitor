# pythonNetworkMonitor

Got bored and decided to play around with python, Im trying to hack together a network monitor script that I can maybe eventually put onto a rasberry pi. Python is weird. This is a work in progress

Update 1: I decided to put a sqlite database into the code to log the data. this table is now temporarily viewable through a print command in the interface

Update 2: Im gonna now build out a ui for this in react. Which should be an interesting project in itself, I guess I can tether the python script to the frontend with an api  call through flask. which I've used a total of maybe 2 times. Should be fun. 

Update 3: Been a minute since I revisited this. Going to make frontend in React / TS since I actually know how to use that. Flask is no longer my friend, New best friend is React.
